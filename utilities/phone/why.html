<video src="video.mp4" autoplay loop></video>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">You have probably seen this video on the internet before, but I thought it would be funny and good practice to recreate it.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">It's not a 100% copy, and because the video that was shared on the internet was using macOS, it won't look as close windows (it's really close on mac though)</p>
